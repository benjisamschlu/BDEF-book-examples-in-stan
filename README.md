# STAN and R codes to reproduce examples from "Bayesian Demographic Estimation and Forecasting" (Bryant, Zhang)

This repo contains codes allowing you to reproduce the main outputs and figures from chapters 11-19 (still work in progress).  Purpose of writing these codes was to get familiar with STAN in the context of demographic applications.

All typos are my own.

Thank you to Bryant and Zhang for this great book!
